errors encountered:
when running ionic build
1. Property 'firebase' does not exist on type { production: boolean; }
solution:
	When you run ng build --prod angular-cli will use the environment.prod.ts file and your environment.prod.ts files environment variable doesn't have the firebase field hence you are getting the exception.

Add the field to environment.prod.ts

2. Dependency conflicts
solution:
	sadlyyy I don't know how to handle this error hahaha

3. can't run ionic capacitor add android because of dependencies
alternative solution
	npm install @capacitor/android --force
	npx capacitor add android
